        " \"Airline-Passenger-Referral-Prediction\" is a machine learning project that aims to predict the likelihood of a referred passenger booking a flight based on historical data. The project is designed to help airlines optimize their marketing strategies and increase their customer base by predicting passenger referral behavior. The project uses a combination of data exploration, feature engineering, and model building techniques to achieve its goal.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data for the project was obtained from historical records of an airline's passenger referrals. The project uses a range of machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, random forest, KNN, and XGBoost, to model the data and make predictions. Hyperparameters were tuned using GridSearchCV cross-validation, and LIME and SHAP methods were implemented to interpret the model's feature importance.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project's code and documentation are hosted on GitHub, making it open-source and encouraging collaboration from data scientists and developers worldwide. The project's main challenge was dealing with highly imbalanced data, and it uses SMOTE to balance the target variable for model building.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the \"Airline-Passenger-Referral-Prediction\" project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in the airline industry and highlights the importance of accurate predictions in marketing strategies. The project's open-source nature makes it accessible for other companies to use and build upon.\n",
