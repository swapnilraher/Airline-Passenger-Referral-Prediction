        "### One of the industries that is being transformed the most by the recent Machine learning advances is the finance industry. Be it predicting the stock prices, or in our case predicting, a customer willingness to subscribe to a term deposit. Therefore, in our project we have come up with a solution that increases the efficiency by making fewer calls but improves the success rate.\n",

        "### In this report, we train a model to predict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit or not.The data set was obtained from the data of direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.\n",
        "\n",
        "### First we did Exploratory Data Analysis on the data set.The Bank data contains 45211 records and 17 columns. It contains 7 numerical (int) and 10 Categorical (object) datatypes columns. After initial data exploration, we didn’t find any duplicated records and missing values in any column. The target variable has highly imbalanced distribution. This was our main challenge. In classification problems we need to keep in mind that only Accuracy score doesn’t give true picture about classification. Accuracy score usually gives higher weightage to the majority class. We looked for outliers and appropriately modify them. We also perform correlation analysis to extract out the important and relevant feature set and later perform feature engineering to modify few existing columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "### We then look at several popular individual models from simple ones like Logistic Regression to more complicated ensemble ones like Random Forest . Additionally, few options for model formulation were tried - first we differentiate numerical and categorical columns, then we analyze both of them separately, we do label encoding on categorical columns too. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Some numerical feature values converted into range of values for model building and interpretability. Using SMOTE the given target variable balanced for model.LIME has been applied on random forest and XGboost also SHAP has been implemented to know more about the important features.\n",
        "\n",
        "### We also tried different algorithms such as Logistic regression,Random Forest,KNN,XGboost using under sampling and over sampling.Hyperparameters were tuned using GridSearchCV cross validation using 5 folds on part of the provided training data set. Among all tried algorithms Random Forest performed the best with F1 of 0.89 score (over sampling) followed by XGboost with F1 score of 0.86.\n",
