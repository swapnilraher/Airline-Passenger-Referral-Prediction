# Airline-Passenger-Referral-Prediction
"Airline Passenger Referral Prediction" is a machine learning project hosted on GitHub that predicts the likelihood of a referred passenger booking a flight based on historical data.

This project is focused on building a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger is likely to refer the airline to their friends and family based on their experience with the airline. The dataset used for this project has been sourced from a fictional airline and consists of various attributes related to the passenger's experience.

Usage
To use this project, you can run the app.py file. This will start a Flask web application that will allow you to input the various attributes of the passenger's experience and get a prediction on whether they are likely to refer the airline to their friends and family.

You can access the web application by navigating to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project has been sourced from a fictional airline and consists of various attributes related to the passenger's experience. The dataset contains 1,31,895 rows and 17 columns. It has been split into a training set and a testing set with a ratio of 70:30.
